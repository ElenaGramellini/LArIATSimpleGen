# LArIATSimpleGen
Description of this Package:
This is a simple MC generator for single particle gun in LArIAT. 
The general idea is to exploit our knowledge of the Wire Chamber data in order to 
construct a realistic single particle MC.

So, I want to generate some single particle MC... what do I need?
